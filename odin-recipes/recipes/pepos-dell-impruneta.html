    <h1> peposa Dell'impruneta</h1>
    

    <p> The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, 
        would place this stew into clay pots and cook it in their
        still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning.
        They used a lot of pepper because the meat was not always top quality.<p>
