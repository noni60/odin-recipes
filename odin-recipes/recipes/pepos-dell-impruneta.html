    <p> The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany,<p>
    </p> would place this stew into clay pots and cook it in their <p>
    </p>still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning. </p>
    </p> They used a lot of pepper because the meat was not always top quality.<p>
